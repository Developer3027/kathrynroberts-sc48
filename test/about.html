        <h3>Stop the insanity!</h3>
        <p>
          I am running for the state seat of the house of representatives,
          district 48, South Carolina. I am an average citizen who has
          always had an interest in politics, but I became very concerned
          with the direction our country is heading after the 2016 election.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up in the Midwest and moved to South Carolina in 2015 with
          my family. My husband grew up in Charlotte and his parents live in
          Clover, SC. My parents are both passed away and we wanted our
          children to have grandparents in their lives, so we made the
          decision to move. It was a bit of a culture shock to be surrounded
          by the kindness of southern hospitality when we first moved. Since
          then, I have grown to love the people, culture, and natural beauty
          of the area we now call home.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many reasons why I finally decided to run for office but
          three of the main issues that concern me the most are income
          inequality, healthcare, and education.
        </p>
        <p>
          I honestly believe in the concept that all men are created equal.
          As I have grown older, the divide between the rich and powerful
          and the hourly workers has become more extreme. They are the ones
          with all the rights while the marginalized and essential workers,
          that truly make our country run, are cast aside. It is time we
          work to bring back the middle class in our country by supporting
          and compensating workers properly. No one who works full-time
          should have to worry about putting food on their table.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also passionate about the education system in our state,
          especially since I have three children who all attend public
          school. It is imperative that our children are given every
          opportunity to thrive and succeed in their learning. A
          well-rounded education should not be one that simply teaches to
          pass a test. It must give children the chance to express
          themselves through creativity and the arts as well as science and
          math. Especially for our girls who have been guided away from STEM
          careers in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          Healthcare is a human right. Full stop. We are the only
          industrialized nation in the world to not offer full healthcare to
          its citizens. The number of people who are forced to file
          bankruptcy ever year is staggering. One of the worst decisions
          ever made was to allow businesses to profit off healthcare. I will
          be first in line to sign my name to any legislation that provides
          universal healthcare to all citizens without lining the pockets of
          CEOs and shareholders first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the coming months, I look forward to learning from the people
          of my district and hearing about the issues that affect your
          family. I have created this site so we may come together as a
          community, get to know each other a little better, and discuss
          issues important to our community. Together we can make a
          difference and start to implement common sense reforms that are
          more in line with our community values.

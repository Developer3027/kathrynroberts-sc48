# kathrynroberts-sc48

Static site built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Kate is running for South Carolina house seat number 48 and wanted a simple site to tell her story and discuss issues that are relevant to the area. I focused on a straight forward, simple design with solid SEO and a simple form to gather emails.

I am happy with this finished product. I am eager to expand upon it when she is ready.

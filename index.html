                    <p>I am running for the state seat of the house of representatives, district 48, South Carolina. I am an average citizen who has always had an interest in politics, but I became very concerned with the direction our country is heading after the 2016 election.</p>
                    <p>I grew up in the Midwest and moved to South Carolina in 2015 with my family. My husband grew up in Charlotte and his parents live in Clover, SC. My parents are both passed away and we wanted out children to have grandparents in their lives, so we made the decision to move. I was a bit of a culture shock to be surrounded by the kindness of southern hospitality when we first moved. Since then, I have grown to love the people, culture, and natural beauty of the area we now call home.</p>
                    <p>There are many reasons why I finally decided to run for office but three of the main issues that concern me the most are income inequality, healthcare, and education.</p>
                    <p>I grew up in the episcopal church and honestly believed in the concept that all men are created equal. As I have gotten older the divide between the rich and powerful and the hourly workers has become more extreme. They are the ones with all the rights while the marginalized and essential workers that truly make our country run are cast aside. It is time we work to bring back the middle class in our country by supporting and compensating workers properly. No one who works full-time should have to worry about putting food on their table.</p>
                    <p>I am also passionate about the education system in our state, especially since I have three children who all attend public school. It is imperative that our children are given every opportunity to thrive and succeed in their learning. A well-rounded education should not be one that simply teaches to pass a test. It must give children the chance to express themselves through creativity and the arts as well as science and math. Especially for our girls who have been guided away from STEM careers in the past.</p>
                    <p>Healthcare is a human right. Full stop. We are the only industrialized nation in the world to not offer full healthcare to its citizens. The number of people who are forced to file bankruptcy ever year is staggering. One of the worst decisions ever made was to allow businesses to profit off healthcare. I will be first in line to sign my name to any legislation that provides universal healthcare to all citizens without lining the pockets of CEOs and shareholders first.</p>
                    <p>Over the coming months, I look forward to learning from the people of my district and hearing about the issues that affect your family. I have created this site so we may come together as a community, get to know each other a little better, and discuss issues important to our community. Together we can make a difference and start to implement common sense reforms that are more in line with our community values.</p>
